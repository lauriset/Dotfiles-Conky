Copy the folders where they correspond and put the point to hide them.
I don't have them with the point to hide them because when uploading them Github gave me problems.

### Polybar
Icons-Left:
Icon-1: rofi launche
Icon-2: left click launche conky, right click close conky

### Conky
Move to /home/your user/.conky/panel icons
In conkyrc line 82 {wireless_essid xxxxxxxxx} change it to your essid

### Ncmpcpp
mpd_music_dir     = ~/MÃºsica     change to its corresponding folder

Excuse my english 
Enjoy!
